        <h4>Andrew W. - San Antonio, TX</h4>
        <p>These guys are the bees knees!  We did two inspections before we found our home (knock on wood, we're almost there!) and our inspector, Tom, did an incredible job. </p>
        <p>Tom was quick but thorough.
            He was professional, answered all 100 of our questions, took dozens of pictures for a thorough report,
            went over every detail via an informal presentation, and was incredibly quick generating a formal report.
            He walked us around the home to show us everything that was wrong and explained everything in a way even
            this guy can understand (and that's saying something).Â </p>

        <p>I hope not to buy another home soon, but if I ever need an inspection or help with
            anything remotely related, these guys are my first call. And I'm definitely asking for Tom.</p>

        <p>My husband and I are in the process of buying a home in San Antonio.
            We hired Inspector Clouseau based on reviews and we were not disappointed!
            Our inspector was Tom; he was incredibly careful and took his time going through the house.
            When he was ready to go over the inspection he answered all 1000 of my questions and did so in
            such a polite and genuine manner. You can even get a "scratch off" coupon when it's time to pay.
            We got $15 off! I would highly recommend :)</p>
